#Bolus_Export

This is an Eclipse Scripting API (ESAPI) script, for use with Eclipse, which is a commerical external beam radiation treatment planning system made by Varian Medical Systems. I did NOT make this program. This was made available to Eclipse users by Varian. 

This program is capable of exporting 3D Mesh files of structures from an RT plan in Eclipse, as well as dose information. I have modified it to ouput mesh files as .stl specifically for "BOLUS" structures. I use it to export .stl files that I use to 3D print Bolus for patients. This is down for plans where bolus conformity can be difficult, like nose or ear.
